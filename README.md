# Stock Tracker
A web-app for users to create small simulated portfolios using real-time equities data using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js) and Bootstrap. Quotes for live equities data are pulled from the Alpha Vantage API.

## Progress
This app is a work in progress, and features implemented so far in the development branch are below:
- Basic user management (create a new account, get a single user, delete account)
- Portfolio for each user which tracks a list of stocks and their corresponding features

## Next steps
Login will be handled using a magic link email so password storage and encryption will not be an issue. I will also integrate the Alpha Vantage API.
